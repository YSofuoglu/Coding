'''
Sudoku is a number-placement puzzle. The objective is to fill a 9 × 9 grid with digits so that each column,
each row, and each of the nine 3 × 3 sub-grids that compose the grid contains all of the digits from 1 to 9.

This algorithm should check if the given grid of numbers represents a correct solution to Sudoku.

Example

For
grid = [[1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 6, 9, 8, 7],
        [4, 6, 5, 8, 7, 9, 3, 2, 1],
        [7, 9, 8, 2, 1, 3, 6, 5, 4],
        [9, 2, 1, 4, 3, 5, 8, 7, 6],
        [3, 5, 4, 7, 6, 8, 2, 1, 9],
        [6, 8, 7, 1, 9, 2, 5, 4, 3],
        [5, 7, 6, 9, 8, 1, 4, 3, 2],
        [2, 4, 3, 6, 5, 7, 1, 9, 8],
        [8, 1, 9, 3, 2, 4, 7, 6, 5]]
the output should be
solution(grid) = true;

For
grid = [[1, 3, 4, 2, 5, 6, 9, 8, 7],
        [4, 6, 8, 5, 7, 9, 3, 2, 1],
        [7, 9, 2, 8, 1, 3, 6, 5, 4],
        [9, 2, 3, 1, 4, 5, 8, 7, 6],
        [3, 5, 7, 4, 6, 8, 2, 1, 9],
        [6, 8, 1, 7, 9, 2, 5, 4, 3],
        [5, 7, 6, 9, 8, 1, 4, 3, 2],
        [2, 4, 5, 6, 3, 7, 1, 9, 8],
        [8, 1, 9, 3, 2, 4, 7, 6, 5]]
the output should be
solution(grid) = false.

The output should be false: each of the nine 3 × 3 sub-grids should contain all of the digits from 1 to 9.

Input/Output

[execution time limit] 4 seconds (py3)

[memory limit] 1 GB

[input] array.array.integer grid

A matrix representing 9 × 9 grid already filled with numbers from 1 to 9.

Guaranteed constraints:
grid.length = 9,
grid[i].length = 9,
1 ≤ grid[i][j] ≤ 9.

[output] boolean

true if the given grid represents a correct solution to Sudoku, false otherwise.
